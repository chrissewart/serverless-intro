A nuts-and-bolts look at Serverless through AWS. 

There's no frameworks, GUIs, or magic tools. There's plenty of other tutorials for that. We'll do everything by hand to try and get some understanding, dispel some of the myths and reveal that it is not all that different from what you're already doing.

Note: serverless isn't about Functions-as-a-Service. It is about composing applications by gluing together cloud-provider servces - try to not build as much as possible.  There's supposed to be a presentation and some persistence and queueing being used, but enough people have expressed an interest in the bits so far to justify a push of WIP.

## You'll need:
- An AWS Account
- The AWS CLI setup
- Node.JS installed 
- Bash, jq, curl and zip (e.g. WSL on Windows)
